      "title": "My honest opinion on Pacagen",
      "body": "I have always been *severely* allergic to cats (burning eyes and asthma). My wife has two cats that I've been living with for 6 years, and I even recently started taking asthma medication. We do A LOT to mitigate cat dander—liveclear allergy food, HEPA air cleaners & vacuums, regular brushing, routine laundry, etc.—but I am always still suffering. I saw their ad on social media, so I googled their technology and found what I believe to be their manufacturer. It seems like a legitimately new scientific approach to allergy management. Make no mistake, this product is *expensive* compared to other allergy products, but bottom line is that I have noticed a significant reduction in my allergies since using this product. It's easy to apply—pretty much just spray it everywhere haha. That's the biggest downside, you spray it liberally to get all surfaces (floor, sofas, blankets, beds, carpets) and you run through the majority of the bottle in one big cleanup. The product definitely works, but I guess the biggest question is how much is allergy relief worth it to you and your friends/family?",

      "body": "A miracle cure to my cat allergies.  Was never able to visit with my son & daughter-in-law who have two cats.  Within 20 min....itchy eyes, itchy throat....I would transform into a creature.  Even with Zyrtec and Flonase I got itchy puffy eyes and face that lasted a day or two.  With the addition of  Pacagen, I was not only able to visit,  but I actually slept in their home for 2 days/nights.  My daughter also has two cats ...different breed.  After Pacagen, I was able stay at her apartment for two days/nights. No issues.   Honestly I couldn't be happier with the product.  The Pacagen is pricey but well worth the value of time and relief.  This a miracle cure for cat allergies. Highly recommend.",

I want to stop taking the pills because there are sides effect to that medication - which are the possiblity of developing headaches. After using the pacagen spray I feel like my symptoms have decreased to just the stuffy nose when I wake up and a bit of sneezing. My cats are also on the purina live clear kibble formula - but its only 49% effective. Additonally I do use an air purifier. I keep the bottle in the fridge so the effectiveness last longer. I do wish the cost for the product is a bit more affordable. I will continue to purchase this product and I do recommend this for people who has cat allgeries and wishes to own a cat.",

My partner has a cat and I couldn’t ever go to their place. But not anymore! I bought the starter pack and walked into the apartment spraying everything. It went so well that I’m at their place all the time now. I can even tolerate the cat sleeping on the bed with us. This stuff is a game changer and I highly recommend!!!",

This may depend on your cats but the hard part for me is that I'm not allergic, is my dog who is. He seems much better but I have no other way to know if I'm using too much or not quite enough spray. This would be great for you if you ha e allergies because you would be able to judge the effect. My niece is coming over next month abd she us allergic, so I'll try to update the review then",

I always felt so bad kicking my cats out. Well, I feel like I finally found a solution with Pacagen sprays. Now I just make sure the rooms are sprayed down every few days and I'm good!!!

Before the spray he used to not be able to breathe clearly through his nose, now his only indication of allergies is itchy eyes in the morning. I prematurely sprayed our apartment before receiving the cat thinking it would provide some sort of barrier but I don't think it worked as well as I thought it could as a pre-cat spray. Now that my cat has been here longer and I've used up my spray, my partner has only had itchy eyes, so I'm looking forward to using the product now that there is more dander in the apartment and notice the change. Definitely worth a try!",

I used to get hives when I'd like really snuggle my cat lol, but now that I've used the spray it's been a lot easier to manage. I am no longer getting hives from my cat, and I feel less congested. This is a way easier and more affordable option compared to the traditional allergy shots etc. I think the only reason I docked a star is due to the price point. Around $65 dollars every 6 weeks, aka ~$550 yearly is a lot of money. And technically the allergy shots could eliminate my allergic reaction to cats 'forever,' whereas this is a preventative spray. Allergy shots are a lot more expensive but I guess for a permanent solution it makes sense. Regardless I am going to use the spray for now, but I do feel like I need to be quite sparing with it. I wish it was half the price so I could really spray the areas my cat visits and feel the full relief, but I understand how great the technology is and the team should be compensated fairly.

      "body": "I have a friend with allergies that can get pretty bad, and I've taken to special kibble and dietary modifications to make my cats a bit closer to hypoallergenic— but that can only do so much. I will say the Pacagen spray definitely makes a significant difference. I couple it with regularly brushing my kitties in the summer months when they shed the most, lint rolling surfaces where cat hair sticks, sweeping regularly, using an air purifier, and the kibble (which honestly is way too new of a development to work yet) and the allergies seem to have gone down quite a bit! My cats can be in the room and be played with which otherwise would have been a big no-no. It's a bit pricey for me as a student, but fitting it into my budget has been worth it to me. The biggest uptick of this is that it is instant, kibble/diet takes weeks if not months to have any noticeable changes not to mention the price of it. I am the kind of person with a better safe than sorry mentality so I go through a bottle quite quickly, around 3 weeks, but for milder allergies I wouldn't doubt that a bottle could last 2 months like the company claims.",

I was feeding everyone the Purina Liveclear food that’s supposed to help with allergies, but soon discovered Purina has been involved in an ongoing pet food scandal. Hubby doesn’t want to resort to allergy shots just yet, so we tried the pacagen spray. I think it seems to be working! He’s had less days where’s he’s congested and inflamed.

Upon rescuing one unexpectedly my allergies were awful, i was taking almost double the dose of allergy medication, day and night just so we didn’t have to return our sweet boy. I had seen the ads for pacagen but was incredibly suspicious but one night i woke up hardly able to breath and knew i had to do something so i bit the bullet and spent the money on this brand and i am so glad i did. The first day i received it i didn’t take any allergy medicine just to see how it went. I haven’t taken any since!! i am beyond impressed with this product, and im so thankful i got it. I can breath clear and my kitty can lay on me and all over my bed and im fine! i have the occasional runny nose when he decides to sleep right under my chin but in comparison with typical cat allergies, its a world of a difference. If you’re thinking about getting it but dont want to spend the money, get it you will be so glad you did! i’m so thankful for this spray, it lets me keep my baby!",

She sprayed Pacagen for a couple days before I came over and once I was there, the couch was actually the best place for me to be in the apartment. And when I started to get a runny nose and sneeze in other areas of the apartment, we got the Pacagen out and tried spraying it there and it would give immediate relief. As of now, it seems like the effectiveness lasts for a few hours and I have to spray it again to not get any allergic reactions. That makes the product rather expensive, but the effectiveness so far has been close to taking allergy pills.",

I've tried just about everything - from every allergy medicine out there to HEPA air purifiers in every room and vacuuming religiously. I've even tried Allerpet spray but unfortunately my cat dislikes being sprayed down. After a particularly bad week with allergies, I bit the bullet and bought Pacagen after seeing some ads for it. It was an expensive purchase but I was desperate to breathe! And luckily, it worked out very well for me. I particularly love how the product doesn't need to be sprayed on the cat. Sometimes I'll spray myself down after cuddling my cat! It works great. I hope Pacagen continues to grow as a company and hopefully scale up so that the price becomes more affordable!!!!",

It only took me a few days to discover that I was actually allergic to him. I didn’t want to part ways with little Walter so, naturally, I went online and researched every possible solution. I came across Pacagen and bought my first bottle on a whim. And let me tell you, this thing actually works!! I have been spraying it around the apartment and on my pillows and bedsheets every couple of days and I haven’t had a single sniffle since. The bottle is a little pricey but it’s honestly worth every penny! As far as cons, the product does have a faint smell but it usually goes away after a few minutes. Overall, this product delivers on its promise and I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with cat allergies!",

The most crucial aspect is that it's pet-friendly, so I don't have to worry about any adverse reactions for my cat. The only downside is the relatively high price, but given how unbearable allergy symptoms can be, it's a necessary expense. While it's a bit costly, the relief it provides makes it worth every penny. Highly recommended for anyone who loves cats but suffers from allergies!",

He was coming to visit so I did my usual cleaning routine, vacuumed up as much rogue hair as possible, and finished it up with a generous spray of Pacagen. He only sneezed like three times over the course of the long weekend that he was here, and usually, he’d be a lot more sniffly and stuffed up. Especially since my pets are all up in his business. Very happy with the results and will definitely be purchasing again. Picture of the main culprit.",

My child struggles with her mental health and I decided we would adopt a kitten as an adjunct to therapy.  I figured if I just took my meds religiously, I might get by with just some congestion.   I was horrendously wrong.   I discovered pacagen and decided to try it out because the degree to which I was using my rescue inhaler was untenable.  I did not have very high expectations and honestly thought I was being scammed.  I was very pleasantly surprised that it worked well.   My rescue inhaler usage has decreased to near pre-adoption levels. As long as I use the pacagen every 2 days,  I have significantly improved quality of life and my child has a support animal that has truly been life changing for her.   Truly grateful for this product.",

We went the first few days without it and the allergies were definitely active. Immediately after spraying I can sincerely say that all worries of rehoming our girl are complete gone. We are able to be comfortable and relaxed even laying all over the couch with her. This spray saves lives of animals who would otherwise remain unadopted and has given me the greatest gift I could imagine- a safe and peaceful life with my partner and our kitty. This spray is forreal and I would reccomend to anyone.",

He came over last night and was able to stay the whole night with the cat sleeping on my pillow right next to him. He was able to pet the cat and totally enjoy himself. Worth every penny to be able to spend the quality time, thank you Pacagen! I'd love to try the cat food topper if you would sell it in Canada!",

      "body": "I bought Pacagen spray as a last resort for my teen with terrible cat allergies. Honestly, I didn’t think anything could truly help so my hopes were not high using it. No other allergy treatment has helped in the past. I sprayed areas of the house that she and our cats frequently used as well as her bed and pillows and didn’t really say anything to observe the results. Over a few days, we noticed that the allergy symptoms (that have been severe and unchanging for 7 years) COMPLETELY disappeared! I was shocked, and so happy with the results! No more allergy pills, no more tissues all over our house! I just wish the bottle were bigger. I go through a quarter of the bottle in just one session of spraying. I would have it delivered more frequently but it is expensive, so I find myself not using it as often as I should to make it last.",

I also keep a very clean house but was getting tired of washing blankets on chairs every single week or more often ….Pacagen works quickly, I’ve had no issues with the light scent triggering a cough, and my kitty hasn’t been bothered at all by the spray. Use whenever I feel triggered or start coughing, approximately weekly. definitely make use of this in the bedroom where I couldn’t even have kitty before.  I also use the spray before company comes if they are allergic to cats and have had fantastic feedback. I have a small two bedroom house and find I have enough spray to get me through two months when I use the stabilizing solution and store in the fridge; that does help with the budgeting.  I look forward to this company making their product more easily and widely available in Canada. 🇨🇦 Thanks for providing a solution that works.",

I started using this spray along with the food topper and the difference is crazy. I didn’t tell my boyfriend when I started using it so that I could see truly if it would help and he went from not being able to sit on the couch without sneezing to laying on the couch for hours with no reaction. The spray doesn’t last very long and you have to keep up with spraying every 2-4 days in my experience, but besides that I highly recommend. I typically spray our couch, dining room chairs, and living room rug since that’s where our cat spends a lot of time",

I decided to spray in the area she was going to be in. I sprayed generously and just observed her reaction. She moved to the living room and seemed fine. During dinner, to have more room to eat, I sprayed the dining room. I guess not enough as I did in the living room. Or did not give it enough time to penetrate the area. She started feeling the effect of her allergies. I was bummed and sad. She did say she was fine when she was in the living room and I believed it did help. I just need to continue to spray more than enough to penetrate the area. My spray nozzle did stop working midway and had to transfer it to another bottle, I will need to reach out to customer service for that matter.",

A few months ago, I moved out of my parents’ house and got two kittens of my own who are slightly less hypoallergenic than my childhood cats. I thought I would be fine, but I was using my inhaler multiple times a day. Once I got Pacagen, I noticed a difference in just about 2 days. It’s obviously not a complete cure, but with an air purifier, a really good vacuum, and this spray twice a week, I haven’t had to use my inhaler in months! I’m so so pleased because rehoming my kittens was absolute NOT an option. I’ve already recommended Pacagen to multiple friends and am very happy to have found something that works!",

No more allergic symptoms…not one itchy eye or runny nose! I was AMAZED that a product actually does what it claims. I spray it directly on the sofa, area rug, and curtains…doesn’t stain and is odorless!

That being said I love cats and my partner and I were determined to have fur babies. We went to a shelter and fell in love with two bonded kittens, so in preparation of bringing them home I ordered both the Pacagen spray and food topper. We brought them home before it was delivered and I was sniffly, itchy, and dealing with wheezing the first 3 nights we had them. I needed Benadryl and my inhaler one night and was starting to get worried. Once the Pacagen came in, I immediately used the spray around our apartment and started the topper that night. Just the next day I felt like a different person. I only used the spray the one time to see if just the topper would be enough for me, and it is! Since using the topper I’ve been able to cuddle up with my kitties, even nuzzle my face into them and give them kisses, things I never thought would be possible for me to do!! It’s made my dream of being a cat parent possible and I highly recommend it!! :)",

      "body": "After having my precious angel baby kitten for 2+ years, I suddenly developed a cat allergy 😭 obviously I wasn’t going to give up my literal child so I started looking a solution. My cat is very picky with her food so Live Clear wasn’t an option. Plus, my sister tried that and had no luck with it reducing her allergies. By the time I stumbled across Pacagen I was going through 2 boxes of tissues a week.  So, I said why not and ordered the spray. When I tell you the relief was practically instantaneous, I mean it! Within 10 minutes of the spray drying down, my wheezing was gone, eyes less itchy, and I could actually breathe! First night in months I didn’t wake up with massive congestion. I even turned my sister onto the spray because her allergies are worse than mine by a mile. Will ABSOLUTELY be buying another bottle, and I’m gonna try the food topper, too. My only “bummer” about the spray is that it has a shelf life of 2 months max which isn’t super awesome since it’s so pricey. But like I said, I’ll definitely be repurchasing because the improvement to my quality of life is MASSIVE!",

I thought that the product description was too good to be true, but I decided to give it a try and all I can say is WOW! I am waking up without a stuffy nose, I no longer avoid having him on my lap, I don't obsess about hand-washing when I touch him. Has it cured my allergy? No, of course not. But it has made living in my own home so much easier and it has improved my relationship with Bash so much that we are both very happy. I will definitely be getting on the subscription model to save money - totally worth it.",

      "body": "My sister in law visited for a few weeks during the holidays. She greatly struggles with severe cat allergies. I ordered Pecagen before her stay. I sprayed each area in my house once a day and started my 2 kitties on the food topper. I was worried that she would be miserable during her stay. She said that she was shocked, how she had almost no reaction to my cats. Normally, she would start sneezing and get itchy right away. She didn’t experience any of that. Her allergies were very mild and she hardly had any symptoms. She is considering getting a cat of her own now thanks to Pecagen!! I also had another friend over, who normally struggles with cat allergies and he didn’t notice anything. Pecagen is a complete game changer and really works! It is definitely worth the price. I cannot recommend it enough!",
