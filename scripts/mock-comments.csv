My honest opinion on Pacagen,"I have always been *severely* allergic to cats (burning eyes and asthma). My wife has two cats that I've been living with for 6 years, and I even recently started taking asthma medication. We do A LOT to mitigate cat dander—liveclear allergy food, HEPA air cleaners & vacuums, regular brushing, routine laundry, etc.—but I am always still suffering. I saw their ad on social media, so I googled their technology and found what I believe to be their manufacturer. It seems like a legitimately new scientific approach to allergy management. Make no mistake, this product is *expensive* compared to other allergy products, but bottom line is that I have noticed a significant reduction in my allergies since using this product. It's easy to apply—pretty much just spray it everywhere haha. That's the biggest downside, you spray it liberally to get all surfaces (floor, sofas, blankets, beds, carpets) and you run through the majority of the bottle in one big cleanup. The product definitely works, but I guess the biggest question is how much is allergy relief worth it to you and your friends/family?",Peter Chan,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Finding relief,I just got my first cat a few weeks ago. I was taking 2-3 allergy pills a day. Now after this product I'm taking 2-3 a week. It seems to be helping a ton. It is definitely worth a try if you experience allergies.,Corey Kimzey,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Cat allergies be gone!!!!,"A miracle cure to my cat allergies.  Was never able to visit with my son & daughter-in-law who have two cats.  Within 20 min....itchy eyes, itchy throat....I would transform into a creature.  Even with Zyrtec and Flonase I got itchy puffy eyes and face that lasted a day or two.  With the addition of  Pacagen, I was not only able to visit,  but I actually slept in their home for 2 days/nights.  My daughter also has two cats ...different breed.  After Pacagen, I was able stay at her apartment for two days/nights. No issues.   Honestly I couldn't be happier with the product.  The Pacagen is pricey but well worth the value of time and relief.  This a miracle cure for cat allergies. Highly recommend.",Susie Miller,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Super convenient!,Worked great! My girlfriend applied it before I came over and my nose was not itchy at all :),Arnold,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Easy to use,"Purchased it for friends with cat allergies, and it's been smooth sailing. Simple to use, highly recommend since it eliminates the need for pills.",Jeffrey Jubilee,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Allergy relief,"My girlfriend has severe allergies to cat hair (sneezing, running nose). The Pacagen spray actually works pretty well for her and along with some allergy relief pills, she’s completely okay to stay with our cat for a long time. Works great so far since I started using one month ago, hope it will be effectively in the long run too!",Xiang Tan,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
"so far, so good","my partner has cat allergies, but I think it's working for him!",CAROLINE NGUYEN,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far it helps,"I got this for my husband who’s allergic getting worse these two years, it wasn’t that bad when we adopted our cats 5 years ago. I sprayed the product in our bedroom while he is taking shower, so far seems it helps. His allergies usually get worse when we have foster kittens, I will try how it works when we have fosters.",Holly Ho,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great alternative to Allergy Medications,This has been a great alternative to allergy medicines. It takes about three minutes to spray our services and it has helped my allergies significantly. I can now rest with the knowledge I won't have to deal with the side effects from allergy meds and make the house feel so clean. Highly recommend!,Josh Reiter,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great product to combat allergirs,"I purchased the cat allergen neutralizing spray to help my partner with her allergies to cats. After nearly a month of use, it seems to have had a positive impact. She no longer has intense allergic reactions when around our two cats. Highly recommended for anyone that loves cats with severe allergies. The spray is certainly more effective than allergy shots or antihistamines alone.",Fraus Masri,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pacagen product review,"My boyfriend is allergic to cats, and I have a lovely calico named Lily. Pacagen is easy to use, and I have found that my boyfriend has less sneezing and swelling under his eyes since I have been using Pacagen.  Fantastic!!",Ellen Nash,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Very effective,Amazing results. Would recommend.,Brian Fitzgerald,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great Product for Cat Allgeries!,"I have moderate to extreme cat allgeries - sneezing, stuffy nose and itchy eyes that will swollen up and I take prescribed allgery pills from the doc because the over the counter stuff is not as effective or none at all. I want to stop taking the pills because there are sides effect to that medication - which are the possiblity of developing headaches. After using the pacagen spray I feel like my symptoms have decreased to just the stuffy nose when I wake up and a bit of sneezing. My cats are also on the purina live clear kibble formula - but its only 49% effective. Additonally I do use an air purifier. I keep the bottle in the fridge so the effectiveness last longer. I do wish the cost for the product is a bit more affordable. I will continue to purchase this product and I do recommend this for people who has cat allgeries and wishes to own a cat.",Cindy Ngo,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing,I have not sneezed or had a runny nose since using the cat dander neutralizing spray.,Carol Rushford,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It helps with my allergies!,I am allergic to my kitten. Allergy pills cannot help and I received Pacagen spray and have been trying it for a couple weeks. It works!,Adelaide Choi,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Finally relief!!!,I have awful cat allergies and my body becomes very reactive. I can walk into a room and know if a cat lives there without even seeing the cat because of the way my body reacts. My partner has a cat and I couldn’t ever go to their place. But not anymore! I bought the starter pack and walked into the apartment spraying everything. It went so well that I’m at their place all the time now. I can even tolerate the cat sleeping on the bed with us. This stuff is a game changer and I highly recommend!!!,Elias Marteal,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
seems working,my husband seems to have developed an allergy to cats (never had the problem before when we had 3 in our house). he is definitely not a pill taking person but has been taking allergy med for almost 2 years. i always feel bad and been looking for safe alternatives. been using pacagen for 2 weeks now his symptoms seem to have got better (coz some days even allergy med don't really work). definitely less sneezy. will give it more time and see hopefully he can start skipping some days on the allergy med. =),Miranda Cheung,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seems to be helping,I bought this spray for my  husband who has some cat allergies and wakes up every  morning congested and sneezing. It's only been about 2 weeks but I do think it has helped. He seems to be a little better in the morning.,Debra Vitale,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
buy more than you think you need!,"I haven't completed my testing on this but so far it seems to work. What is missing are guidelines on how much to use, how often to spray. This may depend on your cats but the hard part for me is that I'm not allergic, is my dog who is. He seems much better but I have no other way to know if I'm using too much or not quite enough spray. This would be great for you if you ha e allergies because you would be able to judge the effect. My niece is coming over next month abd she us allergic, so I'll try to update the review then",Jacqueline Gray,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
5 stars from me!,"I grew up with cats and have had them around my whole life. But because of my allergies, I always had to keep my distance and be careful around them. The big thing for me has always been not letting my cats into certain parts of my house (particularly my bedroom and game room) because I would get allergy attacks afterward. I always felt so bad kicking my cats out. Well, I feel like I finally found a solution with Pacagen sprays. Now I just make sure the rooms are sprayed down every few days and I'm good!!! I had my friend over who also has cat allergies last week, and she was shocked that she didn’t feel any allergic reaction!",Amy,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
No more kitty allergy symptoms!,"My partner started having allergy symptoms when my cat started seasonal shedding so we did a lot of research and decided that the pacagen product sounded like our best bet.
   I used it to spray the couch and in the bedroom and she didn't seem to react with the itchy eyes and skin any more! She has been here on two occasions for multiple days and she is very happy. Thanks for a great product!",Steven Gibbs,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Lifesaver for a multi pet household,We have 3 dogs and 3 cats that we have adopted and allergies are still a huge concern. The cats always like to be on top of us and we love to be able to spend time with them.  This product has made it so much easier to spend time with our rescue cats.  We use the spray often and it has taken away our allergic reaction completely.  I would recommend this product to anyone that loves cats but has allergies.  The neutralizing affect has been a game changer.,Vimal Shah,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Quality & Convenient,"I recently tried this product and I am very happy with the results!! Its a unique way to deal with allergies and it works well! The spray bottle is also really nice, the trigger is high quality, feels good to pull and you can see the mist covers a large area. I will order the double pack next time.",Chris,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Success!,My grandson has been peacefully coexisting with my 3 cats since I have been using Pacagen.  It is super easy to mix and use.,Frances Jones,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works great and pretty much instantly!,"I have two cats and I'm not allergic myself. However I had an emergency because a friend of mine who would be visiting and staying over in my apartment is allergic. I found out after all our plans for a great party weekend where made and everything booked. So it was either finding something to neutralize the allergens or him staying somewhere else, which kind of defeated the purpose of him visiting.

Looking for a last resort to solve the situation before having him go to a hotel I found Pacagen and in a Hail Mary ordered it with express shipping. 

Got it in time and applied it everywhere once on a Thursday which was when my friend was arriving. My friend stayed until Sunday without any allergic reactions in the apartment nor any need for re-applying.

The only time he did have an allergic reaction was when I had just fed my cats and while petting them ended up with a bunch of their hairs on my t-shirt. Curiously he had an allergic reaction that single time without me even touching him, just for being in the same room. Which tells me he is really sensitive to cat allergens but Pacagen cleared them out from my apartment with no issue.

I seriously can't recommend this enough!",David Zambrano,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Huge help,Significantly improved our family’s runny noses and watery eyes. Highly recommend this product. We noticed a near immediate improvement after using it in our house!,Matthew Fahrenkopf,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Packages spray,I think it is helping my cat allergies. My biggest complaint is the container is very small to be able to spray all surfaces every 2-3 days and is quite expensive. I would need a bottle every week,Gail Penly,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Absolutely Life Changing,My husband and I have been really struggling with his cat allergies ever since we got our kitten 2 years ago. We've tried so many products and were thinking about giving Choco to my parents. He found Pacagen on reddit and we were really shocked that it worked so well! We're going to be able to keep Choco now and I couldn't be more thrilled! They seem to be quite a small brand so I wanted to spread the word.,Theresa J.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great for Friends,My wife and I have five cats (three long hairs and two short hairs) and also regularly host friends and family for small gatherings at our house. We got Pacagen's Spray because we have multiple friends and family members who either have allergies or have kids with allergies. Given how many cats we have we still try to be careful when having allergic friends over but we have found spraying Pacagen before having our allergic family members come over makes a huge difference for them!!! My in-laws were in disbelief at first because they usually get reactions very shortly after showing up but they have come over 3 times and had no issues spending time in our living room and kitchen where our cats roam freely. We are going to continue to buy!!!,Jamie Brown,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good!,"I've been using Pacagen for two weeks now, and it's made a noticeable difference! Our allergy symptoms have significantly lessened. Highly recommend this innovative allergen neutralizer!",Farisha Aldean,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
This actually works.,"I am a new kitten mom.  Myself and my son are both allergic to cats. I thought I would give this a shot after reading the reviews. This actually works!!! I would recommend. I also contacted customer service because one of the packages came in damaged. Easily remedied by the customer service rep, and will be signing up for a subscription",Heather McCulley,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Surprisingly works,My spouse has severe allergies to cats but loves them. With this spray we can sleep with our two cats in our bed and she can sleep through the night with no issues.,Ronny Roizin,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
So far so good!,"We have been using Pacagen for about a week, in addition to the allergen reducing cat food from another company and so far so good. My daughter seems to be reacting less in a noticeable way. We’re hoping with using the food for longer, the impact of the Pacagen will be even more noticeable. Thank you for making this product!",Anita Gupta,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Ezcema relief,"Once we learned my son's ezcema was due to cat dander we made various changes and Pacagen was one of them. Cant determine how much of his ezcema relief is due to Pacagen but the combination is working! One star knocked off only because of how expensive the product is. May try a less expensive brand to see if it works. Otherwise, will come back to Pacagen.",Karen Chao,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
So worth the money!,"I was hesitant to spend the money for Pacagen, since it sounded too good to be true, but we're a multi-cat house and I've been allergic to cats all my life, but have come to love our little adopted floofs. Over the years the severity of my allergy has lessened and I take a zyrtec or two each day to keep the other symptoms at bay, but there's always the threat of itchy eyes, sneezing, etc if on of my fur babies curls up on a pillow or blanket I use. 
I started using Pacagen a couple times a week and didn't think much of it that I ran out of my Zyrtec but was able to survive for several days before picking up more, then life got busy and went at least a week without spraying it and oh my! I could not believe the difference! I started with the itchy, watery eyes, runny nose, everything - then I realized I hadn't been spraying the Pacagen. I started back up with my spraying routine and have been happy ever since! 😄🐈🐈‍⬛🐈🐈‍⬛🩷",Liesl Kapfhammer,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Not sure,"I have pretty bad, asthma triggering cat allergies but am a cat lover so I am doing everything I can to be able to keep my little bestie. I bought this spray in effort to reduce allergen in the house. I spray it every couple of days and honestly I can’t tell if it’s working or not, I hope it is. I also take Xyzol and allergy shots so it’s hard to determine what is working or if it’s a synergistic effect that I did not need a trip to ER yet for dexa shot…",Natalia Massar,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
So far so good,"Using the product for 1 month and it is working
I will update my review after a few months",Omar Khesruf,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Great Relief,My husband’s coughing and sneezing has greatly improved!!!,Jeannette Toscano,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Effective!,"I’m moderately allergic to cats, to the point where I took an antihistamine tablet daily and antihistamine eye drops, otherwise I get hives all over my hands and legs. This product helps a lot when used correctly!",Matthew Munguia,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Exceeded expectations,I bought the product when my boyfriend was moving in.  He is very allergic to my cat Festus.  Spraying every couple of days has been quite effective and thing are working out well for all of us!,Lisa Alexander,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
True test coming in November,I am mildly allergic to my 2 cats and I believe I see a difference but not sure if it is the product or cleaning more. My daughter-in-law is coming for Thanksgiving and she is severely allergic - to the point where she said she couldn’t come back to my house!😨So I want to stock up on this product and blitz the house before she comes. After her visit I will be able to give you a true review.,Joan Wagstaff,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
"Seems to work, but I wish it wasn't so expensive","My son wasn't always allergic to our cats, but in the past year, his allergy has been horrible. I started using the spray in the hopes of giving him some help getting through. For a couple of days after we first started, his coughing had lessened. He got whatever bug is going around, but I don't think it's been as bad as in the past. I'm hoping we'll continue with positive results when he's well.

I will say that when I first opened the package, I was upset at the size of the bottle. I didn't see how they'd last two months, so I was a little stingy with it at the time. It's lasted better than I expected, which is helpful considering the spray is not cheap!",Leslie D,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Allergies getting better!,"Since my roommates’ allergies have been getting better, I’ve been getting more sprays so I decided to buy it twice. They can smell more clearly without sneezing every second.",Jessica N,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-double-pack
Still new,Still new to this product but I have noticed a difference. I also get seasonal allergies so being able to stop my cat allergies has helped a lot.,Sandra Cervantes Sandra Cervantes,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Worked Great!,My son-in-law is allergic to our 2 cats when he visits despite our intensive cleaning and keeping them separated. We tried Pacagen this past visit and it greatly changed his comfort while here.,Allan Marsh,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Customer for life!,I've had mild allergies to my cat for the last few years but have always been too busy to try and do anything about it. My wife found this on reddit and we yolo'd purchasing it. It has changed my life. I breathe freely in the mornings and can even hug the cat now! I'll keep buying this for a long time!,Mark G.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Definitely works,"We live in a 900 square foot apartment and it has been a game changer for my partner who is extremely allergic to cats. Before the spray he used to not be able to breathe clearly through his nose, now his only indication of allergies is itchy eyes in the morning. I prematurely sprayed our apartment before receiving the cat thinking it would provide some sort of barrier but I don't think it worked as well as I thought it could as a pre-cat spray. Now that my cat has been here longer and I've used up my spray, my partner has only had itchy eyes, so I'm looking forward to using the product now that there is more dander in the apartment and notice the change. Definitely worth a try!",Minela Ikanovic,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
A Lifesaver,"My boyfriend's allergies have significantly improved since we started using this spray. He no longer experiences the usual sneezing fits or itchy eyes whenever he's near our beloved feline friend. It's like a weight has been lifted off his shoulders, and I couldn't be happier to see him finally able to enjoy the company of our furry family member without suffering the consequences.",Harper,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Fantastic,"Two of our grandkids have severe allergies … I just started using this spray so praying it works! It is easy to use, just mix and spray.",Debbie Minser,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pacagen Spray,"This spray really works. I was truly skeptical as my daughter's Fiance has severe cat allergies. I used this last week, before their visit. (cleaned well then sprayed initial application)
Then used it while they stayed (4 days) for maintenance.
And it REALLY WORKED.
I subscribed.
Thank you!",Lisa Albrecht,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good,"After two weeks, it appears to help.",Gary Schaefer,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pleasantly Surprised,"I was recommended this by a friend and tired it cause getting rid of my partners cats isn't on the table so... everything else is. I'm a skeptic but as I said, we are trying everything and as the title says I was pleasantly surprised by how quickly the effectiveness was evident.",Meredith Johnson,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Spray Bottle,This product has been great for us. It has helped my 2 grandchildren come over without any allergy issues. We're happy to have a solution for this and that they can come visit both us and our two cats more frequently in the future!,Ingrid,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Still testing but very optimistic!,"This four star review is preliminary. We started using Pacagen but have not been 100% diligent yet.

That said, I can say it has never bothered the cats or us. I do think it has helped improve allergies but it’s best combined with removing fur from your furniture and washing your sheets regularly. 

I’m optimistic this will be very helpful. Will post an update when we have more experience!",Hassan Khan,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Allergy help without medication,"I was very interested in Pacagen; I have been taking allergy pills and Flonase daily but with Pacagen, I can reduce that. I love it!",Melissa Evans,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works well!!,"My boyfriend is EXTREMELY allergic to cats, which is a problem because we have a cat, and are also living with my family who have 3 additional cats. Before using this, even with all sorts of allergie meds, he was absolutely dying. It was horrible to watch and for him to experience. HOWEVER! We started using this and have seen a SIGNIFICANT difference in his health!! He still has a bit of a sniffle at times, but he was literally almost in anafalxis before, so this is a miracle. I HIGHLY recommend!!!",Madisen Daily,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Easy to use,I keep a bottle around and will mix up a small portion when we're expecting guests.  It's easy to use and it gives them a nice piece of mind if they're allergic.,Max Yen,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Initial Impressions,"I had ordered this product to see if there is a way for me to make living at home more comfortable for me and my cat. I brush my cat often but it doesn't take care of my allergies completely.

I have been spraying my house with this once every several days and I haven't noticed immediate effects right away. However, after having guests who are allergic to cats and didn't notice any discomfort, it feels like that this product does work. I have to keep using this spray regularly long term and see if it keeps up.",Tony Woo,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Im so glad to find this!,"My granddaughter is very allergic to cats.  I thought I was going to have to keep them out side while she visits, and was always worried I could never clean the house well enough to keep her from having a reaction.  Pacagen was a good solution.",ginny horton,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing effective,This was one of our best purchases of the year! My husband has been suffering from allergies to our cat for a few years and we've had to use zyrtec every time his allergies got worse due to more shedding. We saw this product on reddit and it has completely changed how we deal with cat allergies. We were quite shocked at how quickly it worked (just a few sprays).,Shilpa,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great Product!,"Works well but not 100%, I would say maybe 90%. Cost is a little on the higher side but well worth it!",Jeong Soo Kim,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great!,This product works almost instantly - only complaint is how quickly I need to reapply and will go through this bottle.,Elana Ross,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Best gift ever!,My best friend Amanda sent this to me after seeing this online and I've been amazed by how effective it is. She has 3 cats and I used to never be able to go over to her house because of my allergies. I can now stay for hours and the only issues are a bit of a stuffy nose. I highly recommend trying this! I've now gone to two other friends' places and its been consistently amazing.,Amelia Davis,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Helps with Allergies,I saw this on line and purchased it since my husband has allergies and we have a cat. I do find that it is  helping. When he wakes up now he is  not sneezing as much or as congested. I spray it on the bed and pillows because our cat spends a lot of time there. My husband does not want to take pills so this seems to be helping.,Debra Vitale,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good!,"I've only used one bottle so far, but there are definitely some noticeable differences (e.g., no more hives!). A bit on the pricey side as others said, but it's been working well enough for me to want to keep on trying. Hopefully with consistent use, it'll continue to improve the allergy symptoms!",Staphany Lu,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Super Spray!,My partner Abby found this product through google searching solutions to pet allergies. She and I (Nikki) live together with our 5 beatiful cats. I am extremely allergic to cats and we were looking for solutions to help alleviate my discomfort. We use the product every night before bed and have been super happy with the results. The spray has helped me sleep better and has reduced my intake of inhalers and antihistamines. 10/10 would recommend.,ABBY WANNER,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Helpful for controlling my asthma,"I purchased this product in tandem with an allergy reducing cat food to keep my cat-allergy triggered wheezing under control. Happy to report I have been seeing very positive results and am needing my inhaler much less frequently since I bought it. I spoke with Gary from their team, who was very helpful in better explaining the science behind how this works and recommended uses. 

My only critique is the size of the bottle is pretty small given the higher price point. I can understand why that’s necessary as they are just starting out as a company and need to report profitability to grow. That said,  it would be nice to have more size options available in the future. Overall, I’m very pleased to have found this product and am hoping to see this company grow as their spray is a game changer!",Anton Terrell,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Excellent Product,"I bought this product because my daughter’s cat allergy got much worse after living away from home while at college.  When she came home for spring break, she had a terrible reaction to him—sneezing, water eyes, itchiness, raw/sore throat. After following the instructions for use, it has greatly helped her.  I will reorder as needed, and my only complaint is the high price.",Terri Hoke,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
SO glad I purchased,"I have a couple family members allergic to cats, after using this product they left my home without any symptoms!",Salayha Ghoury,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seems good!!,"I’m not the one with allergies l, it’s my gf.  And so far so good.  But I haven’t seen her too often to test fully. 

Only reason I’d say it’s not 5 stars is the price to amount ratio.  I wouldn’t my be able to afford this on a every day use sort of deal.",Jacob Meyer,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It works! And it’s expensive,Love the product. It really works! Just wish it wasn’t so expensive.,Michael Lawrence,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Noticeable Improvement,"We have cats. My son is allergic to them. We have always had cats. My son has always been allergic to them. It's mostly fine, except when it isn't. We have been proactive about cleaning, and he is good about his medicine. We even have air cleaners in every room, but there are times when he really suffers.

I have been using the Pacagen in his room and in the part of the house where he and the cats spend the most time. It seems to be doing a great job of neutralizing the allergens on surfaces (where the air cleaners don't really help), and my son's breathing (and sleeping) have been noticeably better.

It is expensive. I would not continue to use it, if it weren't truly helpful, but it is, so I am, and I will.",Leslie Gildart,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Fantastic product that really works,"We had a person stay over for 3 nights in our house with 2 Siamese cats. She is highly allergic to cats. Not a sniffle, sneeze, itchy eyes….NOTHING! Miraculous.",Kathy Simons,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works as expected!,This spray works! It's helped improve my sleep and guests no longer need to take allergy meds before coming to my house. Great stuff.,Saul Costa,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Impressive Results,"I bought this starter pack thinking that the spray was included, as well as an allergy neutralizing powder to put in my cats food. When my $80 order came in I was a bit shocked that it was just the spray, and I was also nervous considering my best friend who is severely allergic to cats was coming into town the same day (so I didn't have time for a plan B). 

It was to my shock that despite only having the coverage of the spray, it worked phenomenally. Though my friend didn't stay the night at my spot because we felt that was too risky, she was able to come over and hangout throughout the day without sneezing, sniffles, or any type of reaction - which is not common!! The second day she came over to hangout she didn't even take her Zyrtec because the spray worked that well!! 

My only complaint is that it's expensive and you don't get that much. That one bottle only lasted the whole week my friend was here. So I wish there was a little more bang for the buck, but I'm also not too upset about that considering the great results that it gives.",Mallory Lovings,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Successful!,"I had my hesitations with Pacagen, but after ordering I am very pleased. I used to get hives when I'd like really snuggle my cat lol, but now that I've used the spray it's been a lot easier to manage. I am no longer getting hives from my cat, and I feel less congested. This is a way easier and more affordable option compared to the traditional allergy shots etc. I think the only reason I docked a star is due to the price point. Around $65 dollars every 6 weeks, aka ~$550 yearly is a lot of money. And technically the allergy shots could eliminate my allergic reaction to cats 'forever,' whereas this is a preventative spray. Allergy shots are a lot more expensive but I guess for a permanent solution it makes sense. Regardless I am going to use the spray for now, but I do feel like I need to be quite sparing with it. I wish it was half the price so I could really spray the areas my cat visits and feel the full relief, but I understand how great the technology is and the team should be compensated fairly. Thanks!",Emily Finley,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Magic in a spray bottle,"I have finally met a wonderful, amazing man!! But, he is severely allergic to my cat. I felt an unthinkable decision looming either way it went. I literally laughed out loud when I saw Pacagen on Facebook, but I'd tried everything else, so feeling like a fool, I ordered.  I sprayed the stuff everywhere, laughing the whole time. My boyfriend was able to spend a weekend at my house, with just a sniffle or two!!!! WHAT??? Because of Pacagen, I have my kitty AND my man!!!!",Beth Brown,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Worked great to address my husband's allergies,"I used this in conjunction with a deep clean and putting an air purifier in our bedroom while my husband was away.  When he returned his allergies were so much better, and we no longer had to keep our 2 new kittens out of the bedroom!  It has been almost a month now and he is still doing great.  I spray this daily in our bedroom after making the bed.",Cynthia Fannon,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Miracle spray,"Genuinely shocked by how well this works. My eyes don't itch, I sneeze 50% less, and my mom doesn't get a headache when she walks into my apartment.",Elana Ross,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Would buy again,"Pacagen's cat allergy spray has been a pleasant surprise. Many products over-promise, but this one seems to work. My girlfriend usually struggles with cat allergies, but this spray has made a noticeable difference.",Kyle Galati,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Love Pacagen!,"I was skeptical at first, and wary of the price, but my cat allergies were getting worse and I was willing to try anything. To my surprise this spray has made all the difference in managing my cat allergies. Even a friend of mine, with worse cat allergies than me, was able to stay overnight and not have any issues. This has been a game changer for me. Thank you, Pacagen!",Krys Parsons,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good!,The allergies in our house have remained at bay with using Pacagen! I like how easy it is to use and that I don't have to disrupt my cats special needs diet to use it!,Mary Brownlee,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Crazy!,"We were skeptical! Our son's girlfriend is highly allergic to our two cats and has a hard time being in our house for very long. We were willing to try anything. We've done 2 applications now, and so far, so good! She was previously sneezing excessively and her allergies would cause an eczema flare. Now? After a few hours, a couple of sneezes alerts her that it's time to move rooms (we have a couple rooms where the cats aren't allowed to give her a place to be). SO much better. It's crazy that this works. I'll be getting more. Perhaps, over time, it will even get better!",Karen Cherry,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seems to be working!,"I’ve only been using for a week but it seems to be reducing my partner’s allergies. Absolutely must spray every 2 days, by the 3rd it’s worn off and his symptoms return. It’s expensive tho. Hopefully the price will come down eventually.",Heather Martin,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Promising new approach!,"I have a friend with allergies that can get pretty bad, and I've taken to special kibble and dietary modifications to make my cats a bit closer to hypoallergenic— but that can only do so much. I will say the Pacagen spray definitely makes a significant difference. I couple it with regularly brushing my kitties in the summer months when they shed the most, lint rolling surfaces where cat hair sticks, sweeping regularly, using an air purifier, and the kibble (which honestly is way too new of a development to work yet) and the allergies seem to have gone down quite a bit! My cats can be in the room and be played with which otherwise would have been a big no-no. It's a bit pricey for me as a student, but fitting it into my budget has been worth it to me. The biggest uptick of this is that it is instant, kibble/diet takes weeks if not months to have any noticeable changes not to mention the price of it. I am the kind of person with a better safe than sorry mentality so I go through a bottle quite quickly, around 3 weeks, but for milder allergies I wouldn't doubt that a bottle could last 2 months like the company claims.",Leo Fernandez,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
I think it’s helping!,"We have a house with a bunch of rescue kitties. We have 5 adults and a litter of 5 kittens. My husband discovered he has a cat allergy. I vacuum daily, have air filters around the house and try to keep things clean. I was feeding everyone the Purina Liveclear food that’s supposed to help with allergies, but soon discovered Purina has been involved in an ongoing pet food scandal. Hubby doesn’t want to resort to allergy shots just yet, so we tried the pacagen spray. I think it seems to be working! He’s had less days where’s he’s congested and inflamed. Will keep using this product!",Stephanie Miller,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
AMAZING!,"I LOVE this product. I have been using the pacagen spray for a couple days now and i am AMAZED by the results! i have severe cat allergies and have always wanted a kitten. Upon rescuing one unexpectedly my allergies were awful, i was taking almost double the dose of allergy medication, day and night just so we didn’t have to return our sweet boy. I had seen the ads for pacagen but was incredibly suspicious but one night i woke up hardly able to breath and knew i had to do something so i bit the bullet and spent the money on this brand and i am so glad i did. The first day i received it i didn’t take any allergy medicine just to see how it went. I haven’t taken any since!! i am beyond impressed with this product, and im so thankful i got it. I can breath clear and my kitty can lay on me and all over my bed and im fine! i have the occasional runny nose when he decides to sleep right under my chin but in comparison with typical cat allergies, its a world of a difference. If you’re thinking about getting it but dont want to spend the money, get it you will be so glad you did! i’m so thankful for this spray, it lets me keep my baby!",Madison Knight,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works a lot better for me than pills,"Allergies had gotten really bad and pills weren’t working enough. Spray works great, not 100% cured or anything but at least I can breathe in my own home",Tony Giron,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works perfect,Entered a relationship with someone with cats and this product helped more than any medication on the market.,Customer,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Too expensive,"I'm still waiting to see if this product works. But whether or not it does, it's way too expensive to be a viable allergy solution. The neutralizing spray product only lasts a months once activated (maybe two if refrigerated). So you're paying $60+ per month for a few sprays? That's insane. Allergy medicine is cheaper. Live Clear is cheaper. There are just a lot more options out there where you get a better bang for your buck.",Marjorie Hollander,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
My cats are no longer banned from the bedroom!!,My son’s allergies were so bad with our two cats that he had to ban them from his room where they loved to hang out and snuggle in bed with him.  . But now with the use of the spray he has been able to let them return.  This has helped to create a more harmonious and happy environment for everyone in the house !! It’s great and so glad we found it.  I would definitely recommend this products for anyone experiencing cat allergies.,Alison Williams,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pleasantly surprised!,"I was pleasantly surprised with this product. I have used other mineral sprays to reduce the cat dander. I have a large hairy cat, and I could tell it got to me. But didn’t notice much difference with others. Using Pacagen, I noticed a difference in days. It continued to get better as the days go on! This is something I can’t live with out. Highly recommend!",RONNA FINLEY,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Good so far,"I’ve only been using Pacagen for a few weeks but I think I have noticed some difference already. My cat sleeps in my room with me every night so I  use it in the evenings on my bed and blankets and I think I have noticed less allergy symptoms during the night. Although I am also starting an allergy treatment so that may be helping as well. I only put 4 stars because I don’t know how much it’s helping, but I’ll probably keep using this product in conjunction with others.",Katarina Smith,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far pretty darn great.,"My little 5 yr old grandson developed an allergy to kitties this last year and we have two. His visits would end with red extremely itchy eyes and a runny nose, even with no contact with the kitties. I felt awful. Before his visit today I treated the areas of the house he would spend most of his time and, success! No symptoms at all! I am so thankful, and impressed! Fingers crossed it continues to work this well. Thank you Pacagen!",Nancy Lasley,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
First time user,"Product seemed to help with my daughter's symptoms. But there's not much solution in a single order, so we must order more if we want to see if it really helps.",Gary Heitman,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
"So far, so good!","It’s only been about two weeks since we started spraying down surfaces, but my son who’s highly allergic to cats has been breathing easier!",Deborah Garcia,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great product,"So far, this seems to be working to keep my son’s allergy symptoms at bay! We adopted a kitten not knowing that he was allergic and ordered Pacagen in hopes of being able to keep our new kitty!",Allysa Anderson,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Incredibly Helpful,I have only been using Pacogen for a short while and have already noticed a difference in my allergies. Use of Pacogen in combination with increased vacuuming have led to a noticeable positive effect when I use the spray and I have stopped having issues with rashes and stuffy noses caused by allergies to my cat.,Amanda Bruno,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Promising results.,"So far, it seems very efficient against airborne allergens and clears furniture/linen quite well.",Arnaud L.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
We cuddle again.,"Thankful for this product.

I developed a really sweet relationship with my boyfriend’s cat. We moved in together and I started having respiratory issues and started having asthma attacks after my Pilates classes. We were willing to try anything so I didn’t have to ask to have to live apart from the cat. He’s 13 and it would be devastating to all of us. 

Pacagen changed our little family back to normal and I’m thankful. We cuddle again, he sits with me on the couch and lays on my chest. I feel like myself again and I’m not terrified of developing further symptoms. 

Besties for the restie. I know it’s pricey but I’d pay it every 6 weeks to have our life back to normal.",Sabrina Chamblee,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
An actual life saver!,"I’ve used Pacagen for about a month now and have definitely noticed a difference in my allergies around my house. I like that the spray helps me target specific areas of the house, and compared to some other dander reducing sprays, has no strong invasive smell. The bottle is still going on strong and I’m happy to be more comfortable around my house!",Ngan Ly,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Promising short-term results,"I got this to use at a friend's apartment. She has two cats and I could never sit on her couch because of my allergies. She sprayed Pacagen for a couple days before I came over and once I was there, the couch was actually the best place for me to be in the apartment. And when I started to get a runny nose and sneeze in other areas of the apartment, we got the Pacagen out and tried spraying it there and it would give immediate relief. As of now, it seems like the effectiveness lasts for a few hours and I have to spray it again to not get any allergic reactions. That makes the product rather expensive, but the effectiveness so far has been close to taking allergy pills.",Doris Kwon,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Definitely recommend!,I definitely recommend this product! My boyfriend started to experience allergies when I got kittens. Now I spray this before he comes over and his symptoms have noticeably diminished. I will be buying again!,Katelin Decker,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
When you’ve tried everything— try this,"This product worked really well for me. I was previously using an anti-allergen cat food but had to stop because I needed to switch my cat to a prescription food. This product came at just the right time and has worked consistently better than any other product I’ve tried so far (cat shampoos, cleaning wipes, hepa filtration, anti-allergen cat food etc.) Those products did help a bit, but Pacagen made an immediate and significant difference. Will be continuing to purchase this product.",Kelly Chou,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works!,"I ordered this for my boyfriend who is very allergic to my cat. It seems to help his allergies! My only bone to pick is that the bottle is pretty small, and doesn’t seem like it will last very long, even just for my 1 bedroom apartment.",Martine Wayne,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Super satisfied with this product,"Hello! I am a cat mom who unfortunately suffers from pretty bad cat allergies. I've tried just about everything - from every allergy medicine out there to HEPA air purifiers in every room and vacuuming religiously. I've even tried Allerpet spray but unfortunately my cat dislikes being sprayed down. After a particularly bad week with allergies, I bit the bullet and bought Pacagen after seeing some ads for it. It was an expensive purchase but I was desperate to breathe! And luckily, it worked out very well for me. I particularly love how the product doesn't need to be sprayed on the cat. Sometimes I'll spray myself down after cuddling my cat! It works great. I hope Pacagen continues to grow as a company and hopefully scale up so that the price becomes more affordable!!!!",Michelle Park,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It really works!,I had minor sneezing and congestion even with regular grooming of my long haired Persian. I’ve been using this spray for a few weeks. I spray my bed every 2-3 days. It absolutely helps. I’d say by 80%. A necessity.,Brandon Rosen,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pacagen works pretty well,"Not perfect but it works decently well, combined with vacuuming and hypoallergenic wipes, brushing and some allergy meds its pretty solid.",Dan Tu,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Total Success,This product is amazing!,Jessica Zorns,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works great so far,Instructions are very clear and spray bottle is super effective. The product itself seems to work! I wish the initial package came with a bigger bottle of solution to cover more of our house. This could be life changing though.

It’s done wonders,After using the packages spray in tandem with a special Purina cat food and wash my girlfriend’s symptoms are few and far between!,Anthony Mathison,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
This let me keep my kitten,"A few months ago, I rescued an abandoned stray kitten. We immediately formed a bond so, despite never having owned a cat, I decided to keep him. It only took me a few days to discover that I was actually allergic to him. I didn’t want to part ways with little Walter so, naturally, I went online and researched every possible solution. I came across Pacagen and bought my first bottle on a whim. And let me tell you, this thing actually works!! I have been spraying it around the apartment and on my pillows and bedsheets every couple of days and I haven’t had a single sniffle since. The bottle is a little pricey but it’s honestly worth every penny! As far as cons, the product does have a faint smell but it usually goes away after a few minutes. Overall, this product delivers on its promise and I highly recommend it to anyone struggling with cat allergies!",Andrea Fernandez,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Can't reccomend it enough,Excellent product. We have 3 cats and my wife is allergic but loves the little guys. Works fantastically.,Jacob Sizemore,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pet-Friendly Relief,"I discovered my cat allergy only after adopting a furry friend. Thankfully, a friend recommended this spray, and the results have been quite noticeable. The most crucial aspect is that it's pet-friendly, so I don't have to worry about any adverse reactions for my cat. The only downside is the relatively high price, but given how unbearable allergy symptoms can be, it's a necessary expense. While it's a bit costly, the relief it provides makes it worth every penny. Highly recommended for anyone who loves cats but suffers from allergies!",Yunqing Li,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
My Husband Can Breathe Again!,"My husband began hinting at rehoming or making our cats ""fully outdoors,"" until we got Pacagen. He used to be awake for hours at night unable to breathe and that has now stopped almost ENTIRELY.

Pagacen is a little pricey but worth EVERY PENNY. Don't keep suffering, it works!",Katie Kinney,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Has made my life a lot easier!,"I've only had Pacagen for a little over a month, but I've already noticed a difference. My allergies have really calmed down, which has made it so much easier to spend time with my cat. I had resigned myself to suffering through my allergies for the sake of loving my cat, but life doesn't have to be that hard!",Carmel Companiott,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Must have for allergy prone guests,"We have a friend who comes to stay that has pretty severe allergies to kitties...and we have 2. His throat gets scratchy, eyes swollen, starts getting really uncomfortable after just 15-30 minutes no matter how much I clean or if he premedicates with an antihistamine. He came to stay for 4 days. We started Pacagen the day before he arrived and used it every other day while he was here. Not a single symptom. He stopped the antihistamine after the first day and didn't suffer at all. Such an amazing product!",Michaela Best,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Moved in with my partner and his cat,"When I moved in with my partner I did not realize how bad my allergies (sneezing, sinuses and some breathing issues) would get due to our beautiful cat Sophie. 

I gave pacagen a try and started spraying our bed, Sophie’s bed and other spots she frequents. I can honestly say my symptoms have gone down substantially since using pacagen, along with vacuuming and washing sheets more frequently. No more difficulties breathing before bed or sneezing when I’m sitting on the couch.

Thanks for letting me enjoy my new place and my cat a whole lot more!",Sylvia Elena Jorge,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing!,"I just started using but I have definitely noticed an improvement in my allergy symptoms! I wish it lasted longer and cost less, but I am so excited with the results!!",Christine Gorveatt,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
I was skeptical but it actually works!,"I took in a stray cat unexpectedly because my horrible neighbor was threatening to kill him. I knew I was very allergic to cats but didn’t realize how bad it actually was(my throat was closing up). I added the Pacagen spray, on top of LiveClear food, lots of air purifiers and cleaning daily and it’s been completely tolerable! I do use this spray more than recommended,  but if your allergies aren’t as bad as mine were, I’m sure the every 2-3 day recommendation will be plenty!",Carrie Christa,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works well for us,I use the spray every few days and it works great to minimize allergens from our kitten.,Shahpar Hernandez,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Life-Changing Relief for Cat Allergies!,"This review is from my partner, for whom I ordered the Pacagen:

""I recently tried the Pacagen Cat Allergy Spray, and I am absolutely thrilled with the results. As someone who suffers from itchy eyes due to cat allergies, this spray has been a game-changer for me. 

The application is straightforward, and within minutes of use, I felt a noticeable difference. My eyes stopped itching, and the overall discomfort from my cat allergy significantly decreased. It's truly remarkable how effective this spray is.

I've tried numerous allergy products over the years, but nothing has worked as well as Pacagen Cat Allergy Spray. It's a must-have for anyone who loves cats but struggles with allergies. Highly recommend!""",Pierce Delahunt,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Thank you!!!",Cathleen Jenkins,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
The Best Cat Allergy Remedy,My son and I both are allergic to our new kitty but with Pacagen our allergies were minimal and almost completely eliminated.

Breathing Better Around Kitties,"My wife is allergic to our two cats and was considering getting allergy shots. I found an ad for Pacagen online and decided to try it out.

She breathed better and could even have our cats around us when we were having dinner.",Chipang Chan,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great for litter box areas,My husband is very allergic to our cats and I have tried a lot of allergy sprays. This one definitely makes the room the litter box is in feel cleaner. We still need to run hepa filters in every room but there does seem to be an improvement.,Miranda Nash,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works.,"I didn't think it worked at first, but after the initial 30 days I started to notice my allergies getting better. With three new cats in the house it's a necessity.",Dawn Lyons,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works Great!,I have slight cat allergies and my boyfriend has more severe allergies. We plan on moving in together so I wanted to give a look at some options so I don’t have to put my cat in a room. So I tried it out for my allergies and it’s worked great! I spray it around the apartment every few days and my allergies are gone! Now I just need to try it out with my boyfriend over and I have very high hopes it’ll work just as great :) Super happy and excited that this product could be my solution to my moving problems!,Morgain Baker,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Does Work!,So far it seems to be helping me be less sniffly and congested. I love cats and was thrilled to find something that seems to work.,Clarisse Avery,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Works for 4 Cats!,My husband and I have 4 cats. I was doing fine with 3 but between the 4th & seasonal allergies I was pretty stuffy. No allergy meds—OTC or prescription—helped. You can hot mop your hard surfaces which helps but I was losing to the soft surfaces. Pacagen made a huge difference. It actually works. I love my cats. Pacagen has relieved quite a bit of allergies and stress. I don’t worry about what to do if my kids have allergy. I feel confident no one will be shipped off to grandma’s house over cat dander ❤️😉,Megan Haymier,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Really works!,"I was skeptical at first, there's definitely a lot of companies who promise a simular outcome but I was pleasantly surprised! I brought home my new cat today, and my dad, who is normally in allergic to cats his eyes swell shut, was literally able to HUG and SNUGGLE my new cat! Will definitely be ordering again and reccomending to other cat owners!",Angelyse Jones,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Noticed a difference after 2 uses,"My family just adopted two kittens and after a few days it was clear that all three of us were experiencing pet-induced allergies :( I looked for ways to help manage this without resorting to allergy meds. Ended up seeing this and purchased it without using a product like this before. Used in conjunction with regular washing of living room textiles (pillow covers, couch blankets, etc.) it seems to have made a big difference. We can all snuggle our kitties without sneezing or sniffling after using this product.",Maggie Kincheloe,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seriously Works,"I have two friends that are pretty allergic to cats and usually have to either take a lot of medicine or leave soon after they come over. I've used Pacagen twice so far for when they come over and the first time it was no symptoms for one and barely any and then the second time they could feel a little bit of allergy symptoms, but a whole world of a different than not using it at all. I will definitely repurchase so my friends can enjoy coming over.",Lia Baker,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Allergies are practically gone!,I sprayed this stuff consistently everyday 3-4 days and my allergies are pretty much non existent! This stuff definitely works!!!,Katie Roth,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Surprised!,"My boyfriend is very allergic to cats (well, all critters). He was coming to visit so I did my usual cleaning routine, vacuumed up as much rogue hair as possible, and finished it up with a generous spray of Pacagen. He only sneezed like three times over the course of the long weekend that he was here, and usually, he’d be a lot more sniffly and stuffed up. Especially since my pets are all up in his business. Very happy with the results and will definitely be purchasing again. Picture of the main culprit.",Pilar Neumann,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Severe allergies,"I have severe cat allergies and had avoided adopting any cats for the last 17 years.   My child struggles with her mental health and I decided we would adopt a kitten as an adjunct to therapy.  I figured if I just took my meds religiously, I might get by with just some congestion.   I was horrendously wrong.   I discovered pacagen and decided to try it out because the degree to which I was using my rescue inhaler was untenable.  I did not have very high expectations and honestly thought I was being scammed.  I was very pleasantly surprised that it worked well.   My rescue inhaler usage has decreased to near pre-adoption levels. As long as I use the pacagen every 2 days,  I have significantly improved quality of life and my child has a support animal that has truly been life changing for her.   Truly grateful for this product.",Elizabeth Darby,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Amazing life saver.,"It really helped my sudden eczema reaction caused by cat allergens immediately. Life saver.

Finally my guest could spend the weekend!,"My friend has a severe cat allergy and we never thought he would be able to spend much time in my home with two cats but this allowed him to spend an entire weekend!

Truly a life changing product!,"I've been allergic to cats my entire life. Now, I have 8 cats in my home because I'm fostering 6 kittens for the local Humane Society. I'm able to do this continuously throughout the year now, in large part by Pacagen spray. It's top technology that's well worth the price!  I definitely recommend trying it .... not only is my life SO much richer now, but these little lives literally are being saved by it - because fosters that can bottle feed 6 kittens are hard to come by here!

Pleasantly surprised,"I was skeptical about Pacagen, when we order it but could not be happier. I was getting migraines due to my cat allergies and haven’t had any since using the spray.

It works!,"It reduced my symptoms a lot, but the difficulty lies in how much, how often, and where to spray. You kind of have to play by ear. I finished the whole bottle and gonna get more!",Marina Huang,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
pacagen works!,"our 2 cats sleep in our bed with us and I am allergic. for years i have battled it with an inhaler, nasal spray and Flonase. My symptoms are virtually gone since i started using Pacagen, yet the cats are still as present as ever. Great find!

Some relief,With 3 furry friends I'm not sure this is enough to stop the suffering. I can say it's better but I would also need to use an entire bottle every week to see a significant difference. Too costly for my household.,Eileen Davis,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Working towards an allegen free home,"I got pacagen to help reduce the cat allergens within my household as i’m suffering some pretty rough allergies. So far, I feel better sleeping and I’m getting way fewer hives. I do believe over time and more regular spraying will better my allergies!",Catherine Dhaliwal,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works like a charm!,"Two of my friends who are normally very allergic to cats came to my place for several hours last night and neither of them had any reactions at all! I’m very impressed by how effective the Pacagen spray is. Game changing, would highly recommend!!",Emily Wang,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Worth it!,Expensive but worth every penny!! I will be buying more for sure. Such a stress reliever!! THANK YOU!,Elizabeth Jardine,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good,I bought this because my husband is allergic to cats and my son wouldn’t cooperate without his. So far he hasn’t sniffled once and I think I’m even breathing better,Emily Avery,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
"Wow, it really works!","This has made such a difference in my son’s allergies.

Amazing product, thank you!",S,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
“CAT” tastrophe averted… 🐈‍⬛,"My husband and I haven’t been able to visit my daughter in her new home due to lovely Louise. My husband’s cat allergies are so extreme that his eyes swell shut and his airway constricts within an hour or two of arriving. Allergy pills were basically useless. I learned that the allergic response was due to the cat’s saliva and not their dander so I started looking for a product that addressed that aspect. A quick search brought me to Pacagen. It was worth a try.

My daughter and I were in cahoots together and didn’t tell my husband at first. He thought his cat allergies had miraculously disappeared until the Pacagen expired. We knew this because my husband started weezing within fifteen minutes of arriving. Much of that visit was spent outdoors.

I have since reordered. The jig was up when my husband saw me spraying the family room furniture and carpet as soon as we arrived.  Louise got sprayed as well. What a difference!

If it helps those with extreme allergies, it should benefit those with milder allergies. We spend two or three days at a time there now. Pacagen is a miracle!",Kristi Challgren,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works like a charm,"My fiance is allergic to the dander and hair build up of cats, but with this product, he's had absolutely no issue with adopting and having our senior girl, Snuggles, around. So happy that she's able to sit on the couch, lay in bed and enjoy the comforts of the plush carpet in our home, knowing that a little spray goes a long way to keeping everyone healthy!",Amanda Rodriguez,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So glad something like this exists !!,I have really bad allergies to cats and dogs and have always wanted to have a pet of my own but have never really been able to be around them long term without getting bad reactions. This stuff has helped provide some relief ! Still need to take a Zyrtec when I’m around my cat but it’s better than how things were before purchasing a bottle of this. It’s expensive but worth the investment !,Tiffany Yee,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It works,"I think it has gotten better with the allergies, nobody has any itches from spots that were sprayed that’s allergic, but there’s still a bit of sneezing. Hopefully this improves over time!",Jessica N,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Has helped my allergy symptoms,"The Pacagen neutralizing spray has alleviated my allerrgy symptoms when I'm around my cat, and the spray is easy to use and only takes me around a minute to apply it around my apartment. The only downside is that my cat doesn't seem to like it much as she'll run away from the areas that I've just applied the spray. Otherwise, I highly recommend it!",Zhuoshi Xie,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Relief with in a week,"My husband is allergic to cats, his eyes burn and make him very unbearable to live with him and the kitten he'd grown attached to,  as well has my polydactyl cat, we live in an area where farm cats are sometimes on the surrounding wildlifes menu. We found these lovely kitties and wish for them to stick around, and the only way to make sure that happens is to have them in the house.  The kitten is all over the place. When I received the pacagen product,  I followed the directions for reconstitution and sprayed as directed,  followed by reapplication every 3-4 days. This product is a godsend.  Thank you",Deenise River-Mann,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Life saving spray!!,"I dreamt of owning a cat although my partner is allergic. With this spray, we felt confident enough to adopt and a month later the spray has worked wonders. We went the first few days without it and the allergies were definitely active. Immediately after spraying I can sincerely say that all worries of rehoming our girl are complete gone. We are able to be comfortable and relaxed even laying all over the couch with her. This spray saves lives of animals who would otherwise remain unadopted and has given me the greatest gift I could imagine- a safe and peaceful life with my partner and our kitty. This spray is forreal and I would reccomend to anyone.",Edith Stanley,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Can't believe how well it works!,"I've started dating someone with awful cat allergies. He came over once and within 20 minutes was sneezing nonstop, itchy eyes, so bad he had to leave and he felt the effects for another 24 hours. Sometimes when I go to his place even me putting a bag of mine in the room with him will trigger his allergies. Figured we'd try Pacagen, had low expectations going in but holy cow! He came over last night and was able to stay the whole night with the cat sleeping on my pillow right next to him. He was able to pet the cat and totally enjoy himself. Worth every penny to be able to spend the quality time, thank you Pacagen! I'd love to try the cat food topper if you would sell it in Canada!",Talia Varoglu,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
This Really Works!,"My wife loves our cats and she is also terribly allergic to them. She has these sneezing fits each morning. Since I have started spraying our furnishings with Pacagen, she no longer has her sneezing fits.

Surprisingly effective!,"I was hoping this product would just minimize my itchy eyes and sneezy, runny nose but it actually helped to get rid of them completely. And I know it’s the product because my allergies come back when it’s time to spray again and I can immediately tell the difference. I’m definitely going to be subscribing to the spray now and testing out the new food topper! I love my kittens but don’t love my watery eyes or sneezing all the time. I seriously recommend this to anyone and everyone with allergies. It helps even on top of my daily antihistamine.",Julia Saunders,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

If you can lower the price at some point, would be great",Bettina Netri,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Actually Works!!,"I bought Pacagen spray as a last resort for my teen with terrible cat allergies. Honestly, I didn’t think anything could truly help so my hopes were not high using it. No other allergy treatment has helped in the past. I sprayed areas of the house that she and our cats frequently used as well as her bed and pillows and didn’t really say anything to observe the results. Over a few days, we noticed that the allergy symptoms (that have been severe and unchanging for 7 years) COMPLETELY disappeared! I was shocked, and so happy with the results! No more allergy pills, no more tissues all over our house! I just wish the bottle were bigger. I go through a quarter of the bottle in just one session of spraying. I would have it delivered more frequently but it is expensive, so I find myself not using it as often as I should to make it last.",Meredith Heyl,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

It really works!,"Unfortunately, our kitties are no longer with us, but their dander remained. My husband is allergic to cats. It was so bad that just having the cat loose in the car after the last vet visit made all future rides full of red, itchy eyes and a stuffy nose! I tried vacuuming and lint rollers to get up as much fur as possible, but dander remained on the upholstery.

Desperate, I gave Pacagen a try. Initially, the smell is pleasant, but after sitting in a closed up car for a day or two it’s not so great. We’ll deal with it though because my husband can now ride in my car without wanting to scratch his eyes out! I’ll definitely be buying more to spray the furniture so he can be symptom free everywhere :)",Mishi K.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Works. End of story…,"I’ve got one cat in a small home, am very sensitive to scent, and have had five years of allergy shots that took the edge off symptoms but certainly didn’t eliminate them (likely due to the fact that I am older.) I also keep a very clean house but was getting tired of washing blankets on chairs every single week or more often ….Pacagen works quickly, I’ve had no issues with the light scent triggering a cough, and my kitty hasn’t been bothered at all by the spray. Use whenever I feel triggered or start coughing, approximately weekly. definitely make use of this in the bedroom where I couldn’t even have kitty before.  I also use the spray before company comes if they are allergic to cats and have had fantastic feedback. I have a small two bedroom house and find I have enough spray to get me through two months when I use the stabilizing solution and store in the fridge; that does help with the budgeting.  I look forward to this company making their product more easily and widely available in Canada. 🇨🇦 Thanks for providing a solution that works.",DrRita,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

What a big relief!,it helped me tremendously! Ordering again. Thank you,Angela,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Miracle spray,"My wife has been highly allergic to cats her whole life. It hasn't stopped her from living with three of them, even at the cost of constant sneezing and going through a box of tissues a week on her part. When we found this spray, we were skeptical at first, because she takes allergy medications which don't seem to do anything, and we have three air purifiers running constantly throughout our home that also only seem to mildly help keep the dander at bay.

So, when we got this spray, we were incredibly pleasantly surprised when after a few mere hours post-spraying down the house, her nose was no longer stuffy! She's already using significantly fewer tissues, and she reports being able to breathe easier on the days we spray the furniture down. 

We plan on ordering more spray as soon as we're out. This stuff really, truly works. If it's so effective for someone as allergic as my wife, it'll most definitely work for anyone with milder allergies. Thank you Pacagen!",Tracie V.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
My boyfriend can come to my apartment now!,"My boyfriend has moderate cat allergies that caused him to be pretty stuffed up when he came over.

The product isn’t cheap, but it works.",Candice Stauffer,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It works and easy,My most favorite part about this is that it’s so convenient. We adopted an older cat and we discovered my husband was allergic. We tried other products that need to be applied on the cat but the cat did not enjoy it much. I love that this is a spray version that we can just spray everywhere. I keep mine in the fridge to last longer. In my next order I’ll be getting the food topper too,Misba Gani,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

My allergic partner can comfortable spend the night!,My partner and I are long distance and he has always struggled spending the weekend. Nothing really worked and we had to stay out of the apartment as much as possible. With the spray and some simple allergy meds he barely felt any irritation!

Amazing,"I absolutely love seeing the effects of this product in real time.

The difference is crazy,"My boyfriend has always been severely allergic to cats. He’s tried allergy shots and other solutions, which helped but he was still having reactions to our cat. I started using this spray along with the food topper and the difference is crazy. I didn’t tell my boyfriend when I started using it so that I could see truly if it would help and he went from not being able to sit on the couch without sneezing to laying on the couch for hours with no reaction. The spray doesn’t last very long and you have to keep up with spraying every 2-4 days in my experience, but besides that I highly recommend. I typically spray our couch, dining room chairs, and living room rug since that’s where our cat spends a lot of time",Anna Zoretich,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
This stuff works!!,"SHOCKED that this stuff works.  We recently rescued a 1 year old feral cat and had been keeping her outside but as it has gotten cold, we've let her indoors.

Testing phase,"When I ordered this product, I had a planned trip. After returning a month later, I wanted to see how it worked. I had a friend's daughter stop by unexpectedly. I decided to spray in the area she was going to be in. I sprayed generously and just observed her reaction. She moved to the living room and seemed fine. During dinner, to have more room to eat, I sprayed the dining room. I guess not enough as I did in the living room. Or did not give it enough time to penetrate the area. She started feeling the effect of her allergies. I was bummed and sad. She did say she was fine when she was in the living room and I believed it did help. I just need to continue to spray more than enough to penetrate the area. My spray nozzle did stop working midway and had to transfer it to another bottle, I will need to reach out to customer service for that matter.",A Herrera,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Oh man this stuff is amazing,"I’ve lived with cats for the past ten years and have suffered through the dander making my asthma worse. A few months ago, I moved out of my parents’ house and got two kittens of my own who are slightly less hypoallergenic than my childhood cats. I thought I would be fine, but I was using my inhaler multiple times a day. Once I got Pacagen, I noticed a difference in just about 2 days. It’s obviously not a complete cure, but with an air purifier, a really good vacuum, and this spray twice a week, I haven’t had to use my inhaler in months! I’m so so pleased because rehoming my kittens was absolute NOT an option. I’ve already recommended Pacagen to multiple friends and am very happy to have found something that works!",Ally M,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
INCREDIBLE PRODUCT…thank you🐈‍⬛,"I have 3 family members who are on continuous allergy meds to alleviate annoying allergy symptoms triggered from our cat…itchy and runny eyes; sneezing; coughing; congestion; etc. In desperation, and not expecting much, I gave Pacagen a try and was SHOCKED at the immediate response from my family. No more allergic symptoms…not one itchy eye or runny nose! I was AMAZED that a product actually does what it claims. I spray it directly on the sofa, area rug, and curtains…doesn’t stain and is odorless! Now my family can be in the same room that our cat frequents without needing medication and experiencing terrible symptoms. A huge thank you to Pacagen for a great product from me, my family, and my cat 🐈‍⬛",Thérèse J,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seems to work but still monitoring,Seems to work as my stuck and blocked nose is no longer there. I can breathe easier now. But I still have the hives.  So I'm still observing this product.,Adelin,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Wish it weren't so expensive,I have to use this with my cat otherwise my eyes start burning. It really works well and I can breathe a lot better. I just wish it weren't so expensive. Hoping they see this and figure out how to reduce the price.,John C.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great product,"My son was able
to spend time@ home W the cats and no problems . He's allergic to cats. Your product worked. Worth it!",Elizabeth Whelan,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

JUST AMAZING!!!,"Without spraying Pacagen & using allergy meds, our granddaughter is miserable .. runny eyes and nose, itching and literally tearing up because she can’t be around our kittens.  With Pacagen, what a difference!!!!!  She is one very happy kiddo,happily playing with our kittens.  Thank you!",Gayle CH,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing!!,"I’ve had fairly severe cat allergies my entire life, to the point where being around some cats would leave me with swollen watery eyes, a runny nose, and wheezing within minutes. That being said I love cats and my partner and I were determined to have fur babies. We went to a shelter and fell in love with two bonded kittens, so in preparation of bringing them home I ordered both the Pacagen spray and food topper. We brought them home before it was delivered and I was sniffly, itchy, and dealing with wheezing the first 3 nights we had them. I needed Benadryl and my inhaler one night and was starting to get worried. Once the Pacagen came in, I immediately used the spray around our apartment and started the topper that night. Just the next day I felt like a different person. I only used the spray the one time to see if just the topper would be enough for me, and it is! Since using the topper I’ve been able to cuddle up with my kitties, even nuzzle my face into them and give them kisses, things I never thought would be possible for me to do!! It’s made my dream of being a cat parent possible and I highly recommend it!! :)",Jul,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
What a Relief!,"After having my precious angel baby kitten for 2+ years, I suddenly developed a cat allergy 😭 obviously I wasn’t going to give up my literal child so I started looking a solution. My cat is very picky with her food so Live Clear wasn’t an option. Plus, my sister tried that and had no luck with it reducing her allergies. By the time I stumbled across Pacagen I was going through 2 boxes of tissues a week.  So, I said why not and ordered the spray. When I tell you the relief was practically instantaneous, I mean it! Within 10 minutes of the spray drying down, my wheezing was gone, eyes less itchy, and I could actually breathe! First night in months I didn’t wake up with massive congestion. I even turned my sister onto the spray because her allergies are worse than mine by a mile. Will ABSOLUTELY be buying another bottle, and I’m gonna try the food topper, too. My only “bummer” about the spray is that it has a shelf life of 2 months max which isn’t super awesome since it’s so pricey. But like I said, I’ll definitely be repurchasing because the improvement to my quality of life is MASSIVE!",D. A.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Will continue,Only just started and think it’s helping: will continue,Monica Gorcos,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
It works and I'm so happy,"I had sprayed but had forgotten to spray the morning that my daughter came to visit. I had gotten her two kittens for her 18th birthday but by her 22nd birthday we realized that she had allergies. She moved out with her boyfriend and coming over to visit got her allergies all aggravated again. When she recently came over, I forgot to spray that morning. She made a comment to me after she left that she thought her allergies were gone. That's when I realized that the spraying I had done the day before, had managed to capture enough of the allergen out of the air that she thought she was no longer allergic! This has made a world of difference to her.

Thank you for inventing this product! We love it.",Antonia Reed,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works,Helps a lot to enjoy our cat,Doris Cope,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Helps but how much,Ive been using as directed and it may help some but for how long its lasts is debatable. Also it doesnt last long enough as far as for how much you get what you pay for. Its expensive for a small spray bottles worth. Even with subscription discounts im not to sure the value for the money is there. Would be happier if it wasnt as expensive plus delivery is steep for a small package,Brian,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great product,Bought a few weeks ago and its worth the price,Alida LaRosa,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
BUY IT NOW,"On the scale of 1-4, I scored 4+ allergic to cats on my allergy test… as a cat mom of 3, this was a bummer. I’ve been getting shots, which I’ll need to get weekly for 3-5 YEARS, but I noticed a difference after spraying this around for 3 DAYS. You won’t regret this investment in your health!",Riley Megran,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing!,My son started having asthma attacks when he would visit because of my long-haired cat. I thought this product sounded too good to be true but bought it before my son’s Christmas visit and for the first time in four years he was able to stay here with no issues. I highly recommend this product and am so glad I found it!,Willow’s mom,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good,"“So far, so good! The spray has been working great, and I love how easy the roller is to tear. My cat is still refusing to eat the powder on her food, but I’m trying to integrate it in creative ways. I’m new to this, so I know it’ll take a little time, but I’m loving the concept and the options you offer. Also, the packaging is super cute I enjoy supporting visionary companies like yours. Thank you!”",Kelly,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Won over this skeptic!,"Lifelong cat lover; lifelong cat allergies. I can usually manage but it's annoying, especially with my cuddly kitty. I thought that the product description was too good to be true, but I decided to give it a try and all I can say is WOW! I am waking up without a stuffy nose, I no longer avoid having him on my lap, I don't obsess about hand-washing when I touch him. Has it cured my allergy? No, of course not. But it has made living in my own home so much easier and it has improved my relationship with Bash so much that we are both very happy. I will definitely be getting on the subscription model to save money - totally worth it.",Mindy V,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
No longer miserable,I spray this all around the house when I’m back home for the holidays and I no longer have as severe allergies. Customer support is also really nice and they dealt with a shipping issue nicely by sending me a free spray. It’s even safe to spray on your clothes and yourself too,Michelle Xie,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works so well!,This helped my partner so much! Way fewer symptoms and I'm so grateful for this solution. I do think it's a bit overpriced for such a small bottle - but I understand it's a new biotech solution. Thank you Pacagen!,Julia B.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Sweet sleep...,"Yes, I decided to try the spray first. And call me crazy, but I believe it helped the first day I used it. Very impressed. The sneezing is much less frequent and the itching is not as intense. Since I have tried every allergy medicine that didn't either work or had too many side affects. So thanks for your wonderful product ❤️",Janet Persson,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Seems like it works!,I ordered the starter pack and the food topper. My husband is allergic to cats (we have 6). This seems to be working. Usually his eyes water when he sits on the sofa or is in bed. That has decreased. This stuff is expensive but as long as it works we will keep purchasing.,Karen Schneider,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Works perfectly!,"I had been struggling to take a deep breath for weeks, but within 20 minutes of first spraying the neutralizing spray, I could take a breath without needing to cough! This product truly works!",Andrew P.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Relief!,"We use both products and they do seem work. My cat is a finicky eater but he seems to like the food topper. The spray is great, however expensive- hoping it becomes more reasonably priced as we went through a bottle in a week and that’s not sustainable financially. It has a minimal scent and if it does what it supposed to do, we are all for it. My husband started taking singular as well and we believe it’s all working together.",COLETTE COSENTINO,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
First time user,"We used Pacagen for the first time because my son has terrible cat allergies. We sprayed areas once, and didn’t notice an immediate response, but then went back and sprayed again (as we still had a lot of product left in the bottle).  We also vacuumed first. I noticed an improvement with the second spray, and it seems to be lasting a few weeks. My son used to sneeze a lot every morning, and now we don’t have that anymore. Going to repurchase.",Julie K.,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Really works!,Works better than I could have imagined. I don’t itch or sneeze at all. This spray is game changing.,Samantha F,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Allergies be gone!,"I’ve had pretty severe allergies to cats all my life so when I discovered Pacagen, it was a real game-changer 
Just spray all surfaces your cat comes in contact with on a regular basis and you will find a dramatic reduction in symptoms!",Marc R,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Helped 100%,My son who is allergic came to visit this spray helped a lot ! Will be ordering again .,Theresa Grimes,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Cat allergies greatly diminished,With just one treatment a visiting relative had no immediate symptoms. Highly recommend.,Marsha Draskovich,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Very Helpful,"After using the Pacagen product, my grandson who is allergic to my cat, was able to visit me for a few hours with out an asthma attack. However he is still unable to directly touch the cat. So please help other users understand that they should be cautious when in contact with a cat.",Donna DeLeo,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Great product works as advertised,"I had cat 🐈‍⬛ scratch fever from one of my fur babies this summer- lasts up to 4months.  A few short weeks later I had the flu and lastly Covid.  Needless to say my summer wasn’t great.  So unfortunately I developed allergies to my 2 cats, along with long Covid.  This meant lots of coughing, phlegm in the morning and stuffy nose and runny eyes.  

After using loads of products like air filters, essential oils and medications I have been using this spray product for several weeks.  It has made a huge difference and improvement in my breathing and allergies that I ordered the product for their food.  Fingers crossed 🤞 that this combination works for me.",Debra Coble,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Pecagen really works!! Highly recommend to all who struggle with allergies!,"My sister in law visited for a few weeks during the holidays. She greatly struggles with severe cat allergies. I ordered Pecagen before her stay. I sprayed each area in my house once a day and started my 2 kitties on the food topper. I was worried that she would be miserable during her stay. She said that she was shocked, how she had almost no reaction to my cats. Normally, she would start sneezing and get itchy right away. She didn’t experience any of that. Her allergies were very mild and she hardly had any symptoms. She is considering getting a cat of her own now thanks to Pecagen!! I also had another friend over, who normally struggles with cat allergies and he didn’t notice anything. Pecagen is a complete game changer and really works! It is definitely worth the price. I cannot recommend it enough!",Riley Flake,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
So far so good!,"I’ve only used one bottle so far, and I do plan to keep going with Pacagen. The spray does seem to do a great job - only downside is the amount is quite small for the price and how often I need to spray it. Very curious to try the food topper considering how well the spray is going.",Carla Murasko,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack

Works great,"My mom is very allergic and came to visit for a weekend, I have 3 cats. She hasn’t needed to take any allergy medicine and hasn’t had any symptoms all weekend - we’re super happy with it!",Meg L,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
Amazing stuff!,"I had a relative stay in the room where the cat had slept for a month.  This relative is HIGHLY sensitive, so I was nervous but hopeful.    Night one, he took, as a precaution, antihistamines.  Night 2, he took NOTHING.   There was no reaction!   This stuff is AMAZING!   
    I think I may get a couple extra bottles to just keep on hand.",Nancy,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
it works,"Husband is actually sneezing less.

Breathing better,Since I started using this product I can finally breathe better!   Thanks,Albert Two Hawk,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
This spray worth every penny,I have tried everything for my cat sensitivity. I love my cat but literally have been choking. I went on medicine then inhalers then nasal spray then kenelog shots which lowered my immunity. I sing and have been clogged up so much I about quit the choir. So I bought this spray thinking what could it hurt. Wow  My husband said. Looks like you’re cleared up and the cat doesn’t bother you anymore.  Thanks for this miracle,Becci S,cat-allergen-neutralizing-spray-starter-pack
True relief,"I was skeptical about this product at first, but it actually works.   This is a major game changer. I use it consistently and practice good hygiene around the cat.
